Blind Command Injection on Embedded Systems (using grep, sed and others)

`cmap.py` is a simple blind command injection script which uses the approach explained on [here](http://ceenix.github.io/cmap)

The script is self explanatory and it is necessary to manually add cookies and headers parameters in order to run it.
